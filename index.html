	<h1>Fiction Recommendations</h1>
<h2><i>fiction: literature in the form of prose, especially short stories and novels, that describes imaginary events and people.</i></h2>

<h3><i>The Phantom Tollbooth</i> by Norton Juster</h3>
<p>Looking for a fantastical book exploring wonders and weirdness? <i>The Phantom Tollbooth</i> is a classic children’s novel enjoyable for all ages. Follow the rag tag team made up of a bored child, snarky bug, and a literal watchdog through mysterious lands and explore the magic in everyday life.</p>

<h3><i>Pride And Prejudice</i> by Jane Austen</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most popular Jane Austen book, <i>Pride And Prejudice</i> is just the heartwarming read for all lovers of literature. This book showcases a tad more realistic happily ever after, with a cast of characters that show some of the faults in humanity. Though the writing style is a tad, shall we say dated, this book is still an incredible read.</p>

<h3><i>I Was Their American Dream</i> by Malaka Gharib</h3>
<p>This graphic memoir is filled with relatable moments for all children of immigrants, from culture clash to love for our identities. Gharib perfectly details her life as the biracial daughter of a Filipino mom and Egyptian dad. A joyful book perfect for marvelling over our family’s journeys to where we are today.</p>

<h1>Non-Fiction Recommendations</h1>
<h2><i>non-fiction: prose writing that is based on facts, real events, and real people, such as biography or history.</i></h2>

<h3><i>Bad Blood</i> by John Carreyrou</h3>
<p>This is the story that shed a light on the conspiracy of Theranos, a blood testing company that promised extensive test results with a minuscule amount of blood. When it was revealed that many of the results were faked and the machines used for the tests were damaged and provided false reports, the once revered company fell from high graces, and creator Elizabeth Holmes thrust into the public spotlight for her involvement in the scandal. A suspense filled read, you will be sitting on the edge of your chair at every twist and turn, letting the truth of the story slowly sink in.</p>

<h3><i>Homo Deus: A Brief History Of Tomorrow</i> by Yuval Noah Harari</h3>
<p>A bit more of a scientific read, but nonetheless an incredible one. If you are interested in anything from history to anthropology to just a lot of questions about human culture, this is a perfect book for you. Read this to learn about human structure, whether the future is a dystopian apocalyptic climate, and about human evolution as a whole. And, an added bonus: the perfect “braggy” book to boast to others.</p>
